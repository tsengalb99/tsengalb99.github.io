| I am a first year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Cornell. Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer on the Machine Learning Research team at Nuro, where I worked on autonomous last-mile delivery vehicles. I recieved my BS in Computer Science with a minor in Information and Data Sciences (IDS) from Caltech, where I worked on machine learning research in Professor Yisong Yue's group. | ![](resources/picture-circ.jpg) |
