| I am a third year PhD candidate in the CS Department at Cornell, where I am advised by Chris De Sa. My research focuses on efficient machine learning systems, such as model quantization algorithms that accelerate inference. I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. \
\
Before my PhD, I worked on autonomous vehicles at Nuro. I recieved my BS in CS with an IDS minor from Caltech, where I also worked with Yisong Yue's group.| ![](resources/picture-circ.jpg) |
