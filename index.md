| I am a second year PhD student in the CS Department at Cornell advised by Chris De Sa. My research focuses on geometrically motivated methods toward efficient machine learning. Previously, I worked on autonomous last-mile delivery vehicles as a ML Engineer on the ML Research team at Nuro. I recieved my BS in Computer Science with a minor in Information and Data Sciences from Caltech, where I also worked on machine learning research in Yisong Yue's group. | ![](resources/picture-circ.jpg) |
