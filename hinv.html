              While at Caltech, I started collecting vintage computers, and started the Caltech Vintage Computing Club. I still collect vintage computers, and below is an inventory (hence the page being called <a style="font-size:125%" href="http://ibgwww.colorado.edu/~lessem/psyc5112/usail/man/irix/hinv.1.html">hinv</a>) of my collection. I either still have these items or left them with the club. Last updated April 2021.
            </p>

	    <h2>Parallel computers</h2>
	    <p style="font-size:125%">
              Caltech/JPL Mark II Hypercube - A board from the Mk II 386 based hypercube. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <p style="font-size:125%">
              Caltech/JPL Mark III Hypercube - A board from the Mk III M68k based hypercube. 
	    </p>
            
            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Honeywell WARP board - My dad's, from his PhD.
	    </p>
            
            
	    <h2>*NIX workstations</h2>
	    <p style="font-size:125%">
              SGI O2 (1996) & Personal Iris 4D/25 (1989) - These machines were used by the Goddard lab at Caltech, presumably not for compute purposes since neither the O2 or Personal Iris were particularly fast when new. The O2 has a R10000 and 128MB of memory and the 4D/25 has a R3000 and 24MB, nothing too crazy.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p style="font-size:125%">
              HP 9000 735/125 (1992) - Also used by the Goddard lab, with 400MB(!) of memory in 1992. Runs HP-UX. I tried running NeXTSTEP on it at one point but since NeXTSTEP uses addresses above 64MB for video RAM (thus not liking 400MB of RAM) that wasn't much fun. <strike>640K</strike> 64MB ought to be enough for anyone.
	    </p>
            
            <p style="font-size:125%">
              IBM RS/6000, SUN SparcStation 4/40, SGI Indy, DEC AlphaStation 4/233 (early 90s) - Things I haven't gotten around to turning on.
	    </p>
            
            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Dell T7910 (not vintage, unless you're FaceGoogSoft) - What this site used to be hosted on. 2x E5-2667v3, 256GB RAM, 4TB disk, 2x RTX2070 + GTX1070. Not bad for a machine mostly built out of random parts I found in e-waste. Technically a *NIX workstation since it runs Ubuntu.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              PowerMac G5 (2000s, not vintage but entirely obsolete) - Technically a UNIX workstation too. Worked great as a space heater when my heater in Avery died.
	    </p>
            
            <h2>Interesting peripherals</h2>
            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Immersadesk R2 (1994) - A "portable" CAVE VR system (it's the same size as a Smart Car and weighs 500 pounds). Was used by the Caltech CMS department and Jim Barry, and has a SIGGRAPH '99 sticker on it. The case has sufficiently warped so that it no longer fits through a standard 34" door, making moving it around quite annoying.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              IBM 129 Keypunch (1974) - Was left in an ethernet closet in Beckman Institute for 30+ years until I acquired it. Gave it a CLA and now it works perfectly. Somehow, I didn't win "most useless hack" at Hacktech with a Hollerith to Google Cloud API interface, which I'm still slightly annoyed by. Also great for add cards at Caltech.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              IBM Selectrics (1960s-80s) - A blue Selectric II, 2 tan Selectric II's, a tan Selectric III, and a single dial Selectric Composer which is currently disassembled on my workbench. I have a feeling I'm going to fail miserably at getting it back together.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              VT220 (1980s) - Served as a <a style="font-size:125%" href="https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky">text conky</a> for the T7910. The keyboard controller kept throwing errors, preventing it from being used as an actual serial terminal, but LK201 is so bad that I wouldn't want to use it anyways.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Original LaserJet (1984) - A laser printer, from 1984. Pretty cool stuff for the 80s.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              HP 7550A Line Plotter (1980s) - A desktop line plotter. Made a map of Caltech with it. Apparently the pen accelerates at 10G's (!). Had to use melted ballpoint pens since all the pens that came with it were dry.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              IBM T220 "Big Bertha" (2001) - A dual domain IPS 4K 16:10 monitor, from 2001. Cost as much as nice car in 2001, probably worth as much as that car right now. Requires 4 DVI inputs to run 4K at a whopping 43Hz. 
            </p>
          
            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Mouse Systems M-2 mouse (1980s) - An optical mouse, from the 1980s! Requires its own custom mousepad.
            </p>
            
            <h2>PCs & Macs</h2>
            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Intel (dual?) 486 Deskside (1990) - Massive Intel deskside AT server with 2 486DX50's (or so I'm told, I've only loaded DOS on it which doesn't support multiple CPU's so I haven't verified this), 24MB (on ISA expansion cards), 1MB Tseng ET4000, and 512MB disk through a CF2IDE adapter. Supposedly was an Intel internal test bench machine in the 90s, now it's my DOOM machine. 
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Gateway 2000 486DX66 (early 90s) - Not sure what the Goddard lab was doing with a 486 machine.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Corona Data Systems PC Clone (early 80s) - Got it for free with 2 Selectrics. Don't have an EGA monitor, but it turns on.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              OEM 386 PC (late 80s) - Came with a CRT and light pen (!). Boots into DOS, which claims it has 1MB of RAM.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Zenith Z180 Laptop (1985) - Belonged to the <a style="font-size:125%" href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/caltech-mourns-the-passing-of-professor-kim-border-19522020">late Kim Border</a> from 1985 to 2019. Missing a power supply so I've never turned it on.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Osborne-1 (1981) - One of the first portable PCs. Runs CP/M, came with a BASIC floppy.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Mac SE (1986) - An early SE, with the <a style="font-size:125%" href="https://www.cultofmac.com/122408/signed-by-steve-jobs-co-signatures-inside-the-original-macintosh-case/">signature case</a>. Was used by the math department.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Mac LC, Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (1990s) - Never turned them on.
            </p>

            <h2>Random items and not-so-interesting things</h2>
            <p style="font-size:125%">
              A box of magnetic core memory and vacuum tube (1950s, 60s) - From an alum who is now probably in his 90s.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Western Electric 1500 phones (1960s-80s) - Probably the only person to have had a working fax machine and three landlines in their dorm in the 21st century. Made for a <a style="font-size:125%" href="https://www.wakeupdialer.com/">great alarm clock</a> and doorbell though.
	    </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              HDS Viewstation (late 80s / early 90s) - An actual X terminal!
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Various mechanical keyboards - Seems to be all the rage these days to have a keyboard that annoys your neighbors.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              Various CRTs - Random CRTs, except for a Sony 2K CRT. The first 2K monitor I ever had.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size:125%">
              DEC Rack, RL02, and Front Loading Tape Drive (1970s/80s) - Everything but the <strike>Girl</strike> PDP-11. Apparently you can interface a RL02 with USB, to get a massive 10MB USB drive.
